# QRZen - Barcode & QR Code Scanner for Jetpack Compose

QRZen is a modern Jetpack Compose-based QR and Barcode scanner library for Android. Built with extensibility, performance, and composability in mind, QRZen leverages Google's CameraX and ZXing (Zebra Crossing) under the hood to deliver fast and reliable scanning experiences.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Start by requesting camera permission using the built-in handler:

```kotlin
CameraPermissionHandler { granted ->
    if (granted) {
        // Show scanner UI
    } else {
        PermissionDeniedMessage()
    }
}
```

### ZenScannerScreen

A simple fullscreen scanner with optional zoom, tap-to-focus, and flash support:

```kotlin
ZenScannerScreen(
    isScanningEnabled = true,
    onQrCodeScanned = { result -> /* handle result */ },
    isFlashEnabled = true,
    isZoomEnabled = true,
    isTapToFocusEnabled = true
)
```

### BorderQRScanner

A more visual scanner with a highlighted border scan area:

```kotlin
BorderQRScanner(
    isScanningEnabled = true,
    onQrCodeScanned = { result -> /* handle result */ },
    isFlashEnabled = true,
    isZoomEnabled = true,
    isTapToFocusEnabled = true
)
```

## Under the Hood

* **CameraX** powers camera preview and control.
* **ZXing** (Zebra Crossing) handles barcode decoding logic.
* **ImageAnalysis** from CameraX feeds frames to `CoreScanner`, which reads and parses barcodes efficiently.
